But in reality, your model fails the minority groups.\nThus, even though the aggregated metrics look great, you may deploy a broken model.\nTools: Snorkel\n#𝟯.

            "text": "Here are 3 techniques you must know to evaluate your LLMs quickly.\nManually testing the output of your LLMs is a tedious and painful process → you need to automate it.\nIn generative AI, most of the time, you cannot leverage standard metrics.\nThus, the real question is, how do you evaluate the outputs of an LLM?\nDepending on your problem, here is what you can do ↓\n#𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿𝘀 - 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁\nEven if you use an LLM to generate text, you can ask it to generate a response in a structured format (e.g., JSON) that can be parsed.\nYou know exactly what you want (e.g., a list of products extracted from the user's question).\nThus, you can easily compare the generated and ideal answers using classic approaches.\nFor example, when extracting the list of products from the user's input, you can do the following:\n- check if the LLM outputs a valid JSON structure\n- use a classic method to compare the generated and real answers\n#𝟮. 𝗡𝗼 \"𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁\" 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 (𝗲.𝗴., 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗲𝘁𝗰.)\nWhen generating sentences, the LLM can use different styles, words, etc. Thus, traditional metrics (e.g., BLUE score) are too rigid to be useful.\nYou can leverage another LLM to test the output of our initial LLM. The trick is in what questions to ask.\nWhen testing LLMs, you won't have a big testing split size as you are used to. A set of 10-100 tricky examples usually do the job (it won't be costly).\nHere, we have another 2 sub scenarios:\n↳ 𝟮.𝟭 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 (𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵)\nYou don't have access to an expert to write an ideal answer for a given question to compare it to.\nBased on the initial prompt and generated answer, you can compile a set of questions and pass them to an LLM. Usually, these are Y/N questions that you can easily quantify and check the validity of the generated answer.\nThis is known as \"Rubric Evaluation\"\nFor example:\n\"\"\"\n- Is there any disagreement between the response and the context? (Y or N)\n- Count how many questions the user asked. (output a number)\n...\n\"\"\"\nThis strategy is intuitive, as you can ask the LLM any question you are interested in as long it can output a quantifiable answer (Y/N or a number).\n↳ 𝟮.𝟮. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗼 (𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵)\nWhen you have access to an answer manually created by a group of experts, things are easier.\nYou will use an LLM to compare the generated and ideal answers based on semantics, not structure.\nFor example:\n\"\"\"\n(A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and entirely consistent.\n...\n(E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter.\n\"\"\"\nhashtag\n#\nmachinelearning\nhashtag\n#\nmlops\nhashtag\n#\ndatascience",

Thus, you need flexibility.\nThat is why we decouple it from the rest of the ML systems through artifacts (data, config, & code artifacts).\n𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁\nHere is where you want to take the data, code, and config artifacts and:\n- train the model on all the required data\n- output a staging versioned model artifact\n- test the staging model artifact\n- if the test passes, label it as the new production model artifact\n- deploy it to the inference services\nA common strategy is to build a CI/CD pipeline that (e.g., using GitHub Actions):\n- builds a docker image from the code artifact (e.g., triggered manually or when a new artifact version is created)\n- start the training pipeline inside the docker container that pulls the feature and config artifacts and outputs the staging model artifact\n- manually look over the training report -> If everything went fine, manually trigger the testing pipeline\n- manually look over the testing report -> if everything worked fine (e.g., the model is better than the previous one), manually trigger the CD pipeline that deploys the new model to your inference services\nNote how the model registry quickly helps you to decouple all the components.\nAlso, because training and testing metrics are not always black & white, it is tough to 100% automate the CI/CD pipeline.\nThus, you need a human in the loop when deploying ML models.\nTo conclude...\nThe ML development environment is where you do your research to find better models:\n- 𝘪𝘯𝘱𝘶𝘵: data artifact\n- 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘱𝘶𝘵: code & config artifacts\nThe continuous training environment is used to train & test the production model at scale:\n- 𝘪𝘯𝘱𝘶𝘵: data, code, config artifacts\n- 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘱𝘶𝘵: model artifact\n.\n↳ See this strategy in action in my 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝟳-𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 𝗠𝗟𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 FREE course: 🔗\nhttps://lnkd.in/d_GVpZ9X\nhashtag\n#\nmachinelearning\nhashtag\n#\nmlops\nhashtag\n#\ndatascience",

What is MLE? etc.\"\nAs the model mimics the training data, you must fine-tune it on Q&A (questions & answers) data to align the model to respond to questions instead of predicting the following tokens.\nAfter the fine-tuning step, when prompted, \"What is the best programming language?\", it will respond, \"Rust\".\n𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢: 10K - 100K Q&A example\n𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘦: After aligning the model to respond to questions, you can further single-task fine-tune the model, on Q&A data, on a specific use case to specialize the LLM.\n# 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟯: 𝗥𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 (𝗥𝗟𝗛𝗙)\nDemonstration data tells the model what kind of responses to give but doesn't tell the model how good or bad a response is.\nThe goal is to align your model with user feedback (what users liked or didn't like) to increase the probability of generating answers that users find helpful.\n𝘙𝘓𝘏𝘍 𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵 𝘪𝘯 2:\n1.

Use an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO) to fine-tune the LLM from stage 2. Here, you will use the reward model trained above to give a score for every: (prompt, response).

𝙑𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙡: crucial for the traceability and reproducibility of an ML model deployment or run. Without a version control system, it is difficult to find out what exact code version was responsible for specific runs or errors you might have in production. (🔧 GitHub, GitLab, etc.)\n2. 𝘾𝙄/𝘾𝘿: automated tests are triggered upon pull request creation & deployment to production should only occur through the CD pipeline (🔧 GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, etc.)\n3.

A WebSocket API to listen to financial news in real time. This will be used to listen 24/7 for new data and ingest it as soon as it is available.\n2. A RESTful API to ingest historical data in batch mode. When you deploy a fresh vector DB, you must populate it with data between a given range [date_start; date_end].\nYou wrap the ingested HTML document and its metadata in a `pydantic` NewsArticle model to validate its schema.\nRegardless of the input type, the ingested data is the same. Thus, the following steps are the same for both data inputs ↓\n𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗧𝗠𝗟 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁\nAs the ingested financial news is in HTML, you must extract the text from particular HTML tags.\n`unstructured` makes it as easy as calling `partition_html(document)`, which will recursively return the text within all essential HTML tags.\nThe parsed NewsArticle model is mapped into another `pydantic` model to validate its new schema.\nThe elements of the news article are the headline, summary and full content.\n𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁\nNow we have a bunch of text that has to be cleaned. Again, `unstructured` makes things easy. Calling a few functions we clean:\n- the dashes & bullets\n- extra whitespace & trailing punctuation\n- non ascii chars\n- invalid quotes\nFinally, we standardize everything to lowercase.\n𝗖𝗵𝘂𝗻𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁\nAs the text can exceed the context window of the embedding model, we have to chunk it.\nYet again, `unstructured` provides a valuable function that splits the text based on the tokenized text and expected input length of the embedding model.\nThis strategy is naive, as it doesn't consider the text's structure, such as chapters, paragraphs, etc. As the news is short, this is not an issue, but LangChain provides a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class that does that if required.\n𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝘂𝗻𝗸𝘀\nYou pass all the chunks through an encoder-only model.\nWe have used `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from `sentence-transformers`, a small model that can run on a CPU and outputs a 384 embedding.\nBut based on the size and complexity of your data, you might need more complex and bigger models.\n𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗤𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘃𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗕\nFinally, you insert the embedded chunks and their metadata into the\nQdrant\nvector DB.\nThe metadata contains the embedded text, the source_url and the publish date.\nhashtag\n#\nmachinelearning\nhashtag\n#\nmlops\nhashtag\n#\ndeeplearning",

Hallucinations\nAn LLM  is full of testosterone and likes to be blindly confident.\nEven if the answer looks 100% legit, you can never fully trust it.\n3.

It is RAG.\n1. Avoid fine-tuning\nUsing RAG, you use the LLM as a reasoning engine and the external knowledge base as the main memory (e.g., vector DB).\nThe memory is volatile, so you can quickly introduce or remove data.\n2. Avoid hallucinations\nBy forcing the LLM to answer solely based on the given context, the LLM will provide an answer as follows:\n-  use the external data to respond to the user's question if it contains the necessary insights\n- \"I don't know\" if not\n3.

Auch.\nSo what happens?\nSometimes the model is not mature enough, sometimes there are some security risks, but most of the time...\n...the architecture of the ML system is built with research in mind, or the ML system becomes a massive monolith that is extremely hard to refactor from offline to online.\nSo, good processes and a well-defined architecture are as crucial as good tools and models.\n=== 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 ===\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 3-𝘱𝘪𝘱𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦.\nFirst, let's understand what the 3-pipeline design is.\nIt is a mental map that helps you simplify the development process and split your monolithic ML pipeline into 3 components:\n1. the feature pipeline\n2. the training pipeline\n3. the inference pipeline\n...also known as the Feature/Training/Inference (FTI) architecture.\n.\n#𝟭. The feature pipeline transforms your data into features & labels, which are stored and versioned in a feature store.\n#𝟮. The training pipeline ingests a specific version of the features & labels from the feature store and outputs the trained models, which are stored and versioned inside a model registry.\n#𝟯. The inference pipeline takes a given version of the features and trained models and outputs the predictions to a client.\n.\nThis is why the 3-pipeline design is so beautiful:\n- it is intuitive\n- it brings structure, as on a higher level, all ML systems can be reduced to these 3 components\n- it defines a transparent interface between the 3 components, making it easier for multiple teams to collaborate\n- the ML system has been built with modularity in mind since the beginning\n- the 3 components can easily be divided between multiple teams (if necessary)\n- every component can use the best stack of technologies available for the job\n- every component can be deployed, scaled, and monitored independently\n- the feature pipeline can easily be either batch, streaming or both\nBut the most important benefit is that...\n...by following this pattern, you know 100% that your ML model will move out of your Notebooks into production.\n.\nWhat do you think about the 3-pipeline architecture?

You want to run everything in parallel if possible.\nThus, depending on the use case, it would be best to have a module to compose components sequentially or in parallel.\n❌ If you don't think this through, your code can quickly transform into spaghetti.\n𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n✅ Now, the Composite design pattern kicks in.\n-> 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘔𝘓 𝘱𝘪𝘱𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘯:\n1. Define a standard interface for all the transformations. Let's call it \"Transformation.\"\n2. We create an abstract class called \"AtomicTransformation\" that inherits the \"Transformation\" interface for an atomic transformation.\n3. We implement an abstract class called \"CompositeTransformation\" for running multiple transformations. This class inherits the \"Transformation\" interface but also inputs a list of \"Transformation\" objects as input.\n4. Depending on how you want to call a sequence of transformations, you can inherit the \"CompositeTransformation\" interface and implement classes for:\n- \"SequenceTransformations\"\n- \"ParallelTransformations,\"\n- \"DistributedTransformations,\" etc.\n5. Now, when you want to implement a granular transformation (e.g., normalize the image). You implement the \"AtomicTransformation\" interface.\n6. When you want to glue multiple transformations together, you leverage the \"CompositeTransformation\" classes.\n7. When you call a \"CompositeTransformation\" under the hood, it calls the list of \"Transformation\" objects until it hits an \"AtomicTransformation\" object which will do the actual transformation.\nNote that because both the \"AtomicTransformation\" and \"CompositeTransformation\" inherit the \"Transformation\" interface, you can use them interchangeably, like LEGOs.\nThat is powerful.\nThat is why we all love Sklearn and their \"Pipeline\" interface 🔥\n.\nIf you want to know how to apply other software design patterns in MLE, I left in the comments an interesting article ↓\nhashtag\n#\nmachinelearning\nhashtag\n#\ndesignpattern\nhashtag\n#\nmlops\n-----\n💡 Follow me for daily lessons about ML engineering and MLOps.",

Financial news data source (e.g., Alpaca):\nTo populate your vector DB, you need a historical API (e.g., RESTful API) to add data to your vector DB in batch mode between a desired [start_date, end_date] range. You can tweak the number of workers to parallelize this step as much as possible.\n→ You run this once in the beginning.\nYou need the data exposed under a web socket to ingest news in real time. So, you'll be able to listen to the news and ingest it in your vector DB as soon as they are available.\n→ Listens 24/7 for financial news.\n𝟮. Build the streaming pipeline using Bytewax:\nImplement 2 input connectors for the 2 different types of APIs: RESTful API & web socket.\nThe rest of the steps can be shared between both connectors ↓\n- Clean financial news documents.\n- Chunk the documents.\n- Embed the documents (e.g., using Bert).\n- Insert the embedded documents + their metadata to the vector DB (e.g., Qdrant).\n𝟯-𝟳.

The trick is in what questions to ask.\nWhen testing LLMs, you won't have a big testing split size as you are used to. A set of 10-100 tricky examples usually do the job (it won't be costly).\nHere, we have another 2 sub scenarios:\n↳ 𝟮.𝟭 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 (𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵)\nYou don't have access to an expert to write an ideal answer for a given question to compare it to.\nBased on the initial prompt and generated answer, you can compile a set of questions and pass them to an LLM. Usually, these are Y/N questions that you can easily quantify and check the validity of the generated answer.\nThis is known as \"Rubric Evaluation\"\nFor example:\n\"\"\"\n- Is there any disagreement between the response and the context? (Y or N)\n- Count how many questions the user asked. (output a number)\n...\n\"\"\"\nThis strategy is intuitive, as you can ask the LLM any question you are interested in as long it can output a quantifiable answer (Y/N or a number).\n↳ 𝟮.𝟮.

If the tests pass, mark it as \"production\" under a new version and prepare it for deployment (e.g., model:2.1.5).\n.\nAll of these features are used in a mature ML system.

The consumer will directly load the predictions from the given storage.\n𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞:\n- extracts raw data from a real data source\n- clean, validate, and aggregate the raw data within a feature pipeline\n- load the cleaned data into a feature store\n- experiment to find the best model + transformations using the data from the feature store\n- upload the best model from the training pipeline into the model registry\n- inside a batch prediction pipeline, use the best model from the model registry to compute the predictions\n- store the predictions in some storage\n- the consumer will download the predictions from the storage\n- repeat the whole process hourly, daily, weekly, etc. (it depends on your context)\n.\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 of deploying your model in batch mode is that the predictions will have a level of lag.\nFor example, in a recommender system, if you make your predictions daily, it won't capture a user's behavior in real-time, and it will update the predictions only at the end of the day.\nMoving to other architectures, such as request-response or streaming, will be natural after your system matures in batch mode.\n.\nSo remember, when you initially deploy your model, using a batch mode architecture will be your best shot for a good user experience.\nLet me know in the comments what your usual strategy to serve models is ↓\nhashtag\n#\ndata\nhashtag\n#\nmachinelearning\nhashtag\n#\nmlops\n-----\n💡 Follow me for daily lessons about ML engineering and MLOps.",

If that fails, you know it failed 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘥𝘰𝘯'𝘵 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘵 𝘧𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘥.\nIf the system is small, that is not an issue, but imagine you have 100+ transformations spread across multiple teams...\n🥲 Finding the right error might take you hours or even days.\n💛 By adding multiple data validation points in your system, you can quickly answer to: \"where the system failed\".\nThus, by adding data validation in multiple, you automatically slice the pipeline making it easy to diagnose.\n.\nNote that this is just an example. Your data infrastructure might look different.\nBut the fundamental idea remains the same. Add data validation in all the essential points of your data pipelines to quickly slice and dice the upcoming errors.\nIf you want a hands-on example about using GE to validate your data, check out my article 𝘌𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘛𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩𝘺 𝘔𝘓 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮𝘴 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘝𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭-𝘛𝘪𝘮𝘦 𝘔𝘰𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨.

Therefore, I can quickly build, train, deploy, and monitor recommendation systems for future clients, which will let me build trust and, ultimately, a brand around this.\nThus, I can expand my client base around building recommendation systems. Slowly, I will get more real-life experience in building production-ready ML systems. Therefore, at that point, it will be straightforward to learn to solve other problems and expand my skill set.\nMy point is that in the beginning, it is better to focus all your energy on becoming extremely good at one thing. After, you can quickly build on top of that.\n.\nWhy recommendation systems?\nAfter some research, I saw recommendation systems are estimated to have an annual CAGR of >50% (which is huge).

The dependencies between multiple jobs are defined within a YAML or Python file. For complex applications, this is essential because, for example, if job A fails, you don't want to execute job B. Another example would be that if job A fails, retry to run it 5 times until you give up.\nSchedulers are used for periodic jobs.\nPopular tools: Airflow, Argo, Prefect, Kubeflow, Metaflow\n#𝟐 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬\nOrchestration tools concern where to get resources to run the jobs and how to scale the resources to run the jobs efficiently.\nOrchestration tools deal with lower-level attractions: machines, instances, or clusters. They manage the hardware resources on top of which you run your system.\nOrchestration tools are responsible for scaling the computational power size to efficiently support the given jobs (e.g., if the number of jobs is more significant than the number of instances, it will spin up more instances).\nOrchestration tools are used for long-running servers that serve clients' requests.\nPopular tools: Kubernetes (K8s)\n.\nThese tools are usually used interchangeably.

It represents historical data that can be stored in databases, data warehouses, etc.\nDon't confuse batch features with batch prediction (we will get to it immediately).\n#𝟐 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬\nStreaming features are computed from real-time data sources. These are used when you have access to streaming infrastructure.\n.\n#𝟏 𝐁𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧\nBatch prediction uses batch features to periodically generate predictions that are stored in a database. When a client makes a prediction request to the system, based on some metadata, the system will directly look for the precomputed predictions in the database.  It is also known as an 𝐚𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.\nBatch prediction is used when the model computes the predictions with high latency, and your application has to be in real-time. It is like you are caching all possible predictions in a database so you can instantly serve the result.\nThe most significant advantage of this method is also its biggest weakness. You need a database and computing power to generate predictions for all possible combinations (e.g., in a song recommendation system, you must compute all the recommendations for your users hourly), which might be costly and redundant. Imagine that you have 100k users and only 1k use your app daily. If you compute your predictions daily, 99k of predictions are redundantly computed.\n#𝟐 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧\nOnline prediction can use both batch features and streaming features to make predictions. It is a more intuitive method as it is the usual way to do things. When a client makes a prediction request to the system, the prediction is computed by the model on demand. It is also known as a 𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.\nOnline prediction is used when the system has to be real-time, and the model predictions can be calculated with low latency. Also, in many cases, you are forced to apply the online prediction pattern because you can't possibly compute all the combinations required for your users (e.g., an NLP translation app can't compute all the combinations between all the sentence options and languages).\n.\nBoth methods can be used for real-time predictions. Only the way the predictions are served is different.\nAlso, these two methods are complementary. For example, you can use batch prediction for your top most common requests and make an online prediction for the rest.\n.\n💡 My goal is to make\nhashtag\n#\nml\neasy and intuitive.

(See link to press release in the comments)\nOn a personal note, I hope this show will serve as a bridge from thought to action for millions of people around the world who are cradling a dream but are somehow stuck. I know how hard it is to come from nothing, muster the courage to quit the grind, leave your fears behind, and bet on yourself.  I believe “Business Hunters” will empower a whole new generation of aspiring business owners by demystifying this opaque process.\nI'm so grateful and honored that Mark Burnett and Barry Poznick at MGM, and Mark Hoffman and Denise Contis at CNBC have entrusted me to host this life-changing show.\nWatch out for “Business Hunters” coming this Fall!\nhashtag\n#\nBusinessHunters\nhashtag\n#\nCNBC\nhashtag\n#\nentrepreneurship"
